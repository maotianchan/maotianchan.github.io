Hi, I'm Mao Tianchan.I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Communication Studies at Fudan University (2023). Before that, I received my B. A of Journalism in Zhejiang University(2018). I'm also a visiting Ph.D. student in the Department of Communication and New Media at the National University of Singapore (2022-2023) and recognized as the China Association for Science and Technology Young Scholar in 2022.

My recent research primarily focuses on platform studies, media industry, and media sociology. While I have a preference for qualitative research methods, I acknowledges that the academic journey should be multi-approached. Consequently,I'm also keen to use quantitative and computational methods to investigate research questions. I have  already published over 10 papers in SSCI, CSSCI, and ICA conferences until now, and successfully led a provincial research project in China, earning academic awards for  provincial-level and national-level research contributions.

In my leisure time, I am a literature, art, and cooking enthusiast. I'm also deeply passionate about table tennis, hiking, and yoga. I believe that the essence of academic research lies in a profound dialogue between oneself and nature. Literature, art, history, music, and sports all contribute to enriching our imagination and understanding of the contemporary world.
