<h3>Plarform and Cultural Production</h3>
My PhD dissertation focuses on the platformization of the film and television industry in the Yangtze River Delta region of China. Employing the theoretical framework of innovation networks, I investigate how the emergence of streaming platforms such as iQiyi, Youku, and Tencent Video reshape the professional knowledge networks, producer networks, and governance networks that were originally based on physical clusters in the film and television production. Through this analysis, I aim to shed light on the platformization of the traditional media industry within the Chinese context. In the future, I will continue to explore topics related to how platforms reshape digital cultural production.


我的博士论文研究的是中国长三角地区影视产业的平台化转型。通过引入创新网络这一理论，我探究了爱奇艺、优酷、腾讯视频这些流媒体平台的崛起，如何重塑原本基于实体集群的影视生产的专业知识网络、生产者网络与治理网络，并从中分析传统媒体行业平台化的中国语境。未来我也会继续关注平台如何重塑数字文化生产的相关议题。

<h3>Platformization of Media Industry</h3>

My long-term commitment is positioning the study of Digital China within the context of the global platform economy. My published works primarily delve into “the paradox of Tencent's openness and monopoly”, “how Tencent reshapes the industrial chain of digital cultural production in China”, and “the geo-economy bottlenecks resulting from its internal infrastructuralization pattern”. The topics that interest me extend beyond how platformization reshapes traditional industries and individual lives; I am also intrigued by how platformization unfolds and evolves in different global contexts and where its boundary lies.

我长期致力于在全球平台经济发展的背景下定位数字中国的研究。目前发表的成果主要涉及，腾讯开放与垄断的悖论、腾讯如何重塑中国数字文化生产的产业链、以及其内眷式的基础设施化进程造成的地缘瓶颈。我感兴趣的议题不仅包括平台化如何重塑传统行业与个体生活，更有在全球不同的语境中，平台化是如何发生的、又是怎样演化的、其边界在何处.

<h3>Platform Governance</h3>

The social value of platform study requires returning to the topic of platform governance. The issues I want to include not only how platforms are governed but also how they govern their internal user and producer systems. I firmly believe that as multi-side markets, platforms ultimately aim to achieve openness and connectivity, contributing to the well-developed of society through Information communication technologies.

平台研究的社会价值要回归如何实现平台治理。我关注的议题既包括平台如何被治理，也包括平台如何治理其内部的用户与生产者体系。我相信平台作为多边市场，其最终的旨归在于实现开放和连接，而这也是信息传播技术理应带给公共社会的福祉。
